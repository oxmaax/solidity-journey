# solidity-journey

a repo to track my progress learning solidity and smart contract development.

## contracts

- `SimpleStorage.sol`  
  basic contract to store and update a single unsigned integer.
- `Counter.sol`  
  simple counter that can be incremented and decremented.

## goals

- understand solidity basics (state variables, functions, events).
- learn how to deploy and interact with contracts on testnets.
- experiment with simple defi-style contracts later.

## notes

this repo is mainly for learning and practice. feedback and suggestions are welcome.
